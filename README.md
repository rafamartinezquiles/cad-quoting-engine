# CAD Quoting Engine
This project implements a multimodal pipeline capable of analyzing 3D CAD files and generating real-time cost and lead time estimates for CNC machining. It leverages tools like `trimesh`, `cadquery`, and `pythonOCC` to extract geometric features and estimate manufacturing complexity. The engine outputs per-unit costs, material breakdowns, and machining time, helping automate the manufacturing sourcing process.
