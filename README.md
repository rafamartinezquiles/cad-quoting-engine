# cad-quoting-engine
This project implements a multimodal pipeline capable of analyzing 3D CAD files and generating real-time cost and lead time estimates for CNC machining. It leverages cutting-edge tools like trimesh, cadquery, and pythonOCC to extract geometric features, calculate complexity, and drive a quoting engine based on physical and economic parameters.
